2048-Android by Fahmi

This is my personal Android port of the famous 2048 game. It's a simple WebView-based app that loads the locally stored HTML files of the original 2048 game, allowing you to enjoy the game offline without requiring an internet connection. The app doesn't ask for any permissions, and it provides quick access to the game with an icon on your smartphoneâ€™s home screen.

Feel free to contribute with pull requests or share any Android-specific improvements that you have in mind!
